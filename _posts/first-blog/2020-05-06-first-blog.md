description: The reason of starting a blog and how I got inspired
---

Well starting a new thing has always been a long procrastinating journey. But in the end, we just have to get up and accomplish it. As I am doing right now sacrificing my comforting sleep before suhoor(Food eaten before fast).

## Let's start from the start
#### My inspiration
I guess there a lot of people to inspire me to start my own space for blogging. From seniors developers like [Kushal Das](https://kushaldas.in/) to outstanding peers like [Rahul Jha](https://rj722.github.io/) and amazing juniors like [Prajjwal Nijhara](https://pnijhara.me/about/). But none of them made me do it for myself. It was completely due to the spontaneous amount of knowledge bursts in my head that lead me to start writing blogs. But I assure you, I will keep my writings well articulated with references, away from the chaos in my head. It’s more like organizing the chaos rather than curbing it.
#### The topics I will be dicussing
1. Politics: On my recent activity on Twitter due to an increase of unjust acts by the ruling party, and due to our university usually targetted, I have been reading about politics since the last year. I’m completely well versed about a lot of things, but I’ll be posting whatever I’ll be learning alongside about the destruction of the largest democracy in this world.
2. Psychology: I have been interested in the human mind and how does it take actions consciously and/or subconsciously. I have been reading books like [The Power of the Subconscious Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Your-Subconscious-Mind-ebook/dp/B0773RQ55P/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The+Power+of+Your+Subconscious+Mind&qid=1588710685&s=books&sr=1-1) by Dr. Joseph Murhpy and also [The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in Tech World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Distracted-Mind-Ancient-Brains-High-Tech/dp/0262034948) by Adam Gazzaley and Larry D. Rosen.
3. Technology: I may be writing about my learnings in my field of robotics, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicles. Maybe tutorials would be better.
