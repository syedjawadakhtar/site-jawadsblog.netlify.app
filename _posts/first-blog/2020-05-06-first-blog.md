description: The reason of starting a blog and how I got inspired
---

Well starting a new thing has always been a long procrastinating journey. But in the end, we just have to get up and accomplish it. As I am doing right now by writing this at 3 am in the morning.

## Let's start from the start 
#### My inspiration

> A pen is mightier than a sword!

I guess there were a lot of people to inspire me to start my own space for blogging. From senior developers like [Kushal Das](https://kushaldas.in/) to outstanding peers like [Rahul Jha](https://rj722.github.io/) and amazing juniors like [Prajjwal Nijhara](https://pnijhara.me/about/) and [Prateek Jain](https://prateekj117.me). Even though it was only about their websites that intrigued me because I have been writing in my diaries/notepads whenever I needed to relieve myself from a mind-bothering idea. But then writing it in a public domain is totally a different thing. It is more about making clear points about the topic and not just blurting out the chaos from your mind. So to learn this art, I picked a blogging Jekyll-theme online and started it all.

#### The topics I may pen down:
_Note: The categories may change with respect to time due to any reasons._

1.**Technology:** I'm a computer engineering student and my writings wil be about my learnings in the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicles. This may be in the form of _experiences_ or _tutorials_.

2.**General psychology:** I have been interested in the human mind and how does it take actions consciously and/or subconsciously. I have been reading books like [The Power of the Subconscious Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Your-Subconscious-Mind-ebook/dp/B0773RQ55P/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The+Power+of+Your+Subconscious+Mind&qid=1588710685&s=books&sr=1-1) and [The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in Tech World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Distracted-Mind-Ancient-Brains-High-Tech/dp/0262034948). So most probably I may be discussing about my _observations_ about _actions_ in this world from different prespective.

3.**Politics:** I've had become active on Twitter ([my handle](https://www.twitter.com/syedjawadakhtar)) since my university started being targetted by media houses and political parties in 2018. Since then my mind has been picking up a lot of topics with the constant unrest in the country. Here I'll express my views about the topics, and anyone is welcome for having a logical discussion on it.
