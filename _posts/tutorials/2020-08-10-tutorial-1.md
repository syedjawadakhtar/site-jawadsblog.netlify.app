## [Tutorial] Solve the recurring PCIe error during dual-booting Ubuntu in HP Pavilion Laptop

Specification of my laptop:

HP - Pavilion Notebook | 16 GB RAM | Storage - 128 SSD + 1 TB HDD | Intel Core i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz x 4 | NVIDIA GeForce Graphics

### Background

This had been causing me trouble since I wanted to dual boot on my laptop with windows 10. At first, I deducted that the SSD + HDD hybrid storage is making the problem, and the boot files must be loaded on either one of the drives. Tried storing the boot files of windows and ubuntu at the same place in SSD, as well as stored in different drives, it gave negative output. The error persisted when I tried to shut down. This usually led to the filing of large log files in the `/var/log` folder and shutting down by 'Hard shutdown' method. Deleting these unnecessary log files or 'rotating log files' didn't help in any way, as it filled again at reboot.

After a lot of scrapping Ubuntu forums and hit and trial methods, a simple change in the grub config file did my job on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

The error came back haunting me while upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but it didn't show itself at first. This time the installation always got hanged just after creating user and gave unexpected errors after prolonged period. As didn't know about the error in the beginning, so I changed ISO files and bootable pen drives, tried updating `grub command prompt` that popped whenever tried to boot, checked disks `fdisk` using `Try Ubuntu` mode.

Lest during this my Windows 10 OS went through some shit and it didn't boot as well. So I opted teh last resort of wiping everything off and starting anew. Just before that, I tried to duckduckgo again, the `PCIe bus error` which only showed when rebooting from `Try Ubuntu` mode. Following some threads, it was revealec that the problem that halted the installation - only when it started detecting the **laptop hardware**, hence "solve the _PCIe bus error_" at installation level. Therefore, the main problem is with the hardware of HP laptops.

It was apprehended that this error can't be fixed completely, but only dodged using the method below.

### Steps to solve the error

#### To get through the installation (using bootable Pendrive)

1. At startup, press <kbd>E</kbd> when hovered on `Install ubuntu`.
2. Add `pci = nommconf` at the end of the line `... splash`.
3. Then press <kbd>Esc</kbd> and go through the installation.
4. When the installation is complete, boot to Ubuntu OS.
5. Go and edit the grub file before rebooting again.

#### Updating configure file in Ubuntu

1.Open terminal - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>

2.Make a back-up of the grub config file, so that you can save yourself if things get messed up.

```bash
cp /etc/default/grub ~/grub.back
```

3.Open gedit for editing

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
```

4.Look for the line **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”**. Add `pci=noaer` at the end of this line. AER stands for _Advanced Error Reporting_ and ‘noaer’ asks the kernel to not use/log Advanced Error Reporting. The changed line should look like this:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=noaer"
```

5.Update grub file

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

6.Restart Ubuntu 'PCIe Bus Error' won't be seen anymore.

Hope this helps anyone who is struggling with this problem in his/her HP laptops.
